+# FightClub
+A Pokemon Battle (Fight) Club Scheduler
+
+A project developed and created by Blake Geraci, Isabelle Griffin, and Bri Velozo for CSI 254: Java Programming I. 
+
+The project includes a Javadoc located in the dist folder (and accessed via the index.html page). 
+
+# What the project does: 
+  Allows you to schedule "battles" between two opponents at a designated time and date. The scheduler is also able to determine what bracket (or usage tier of Pokemon) are allowed to be used. More information can be found [here](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Tier). Dates are very flexibly chosen and the battles for a given month are displayed on a panel visible on the right side of the Calendar frame. 
+  
+# Organization: 
+  
+The front end is built using Java's Swing GUI framework built using the NetBeans editor. The back end is built using the core Java language with File IO utilities that enable relative path usage and more dynamic file reading/writing. At it's core, the battles are stored as Battle objects within a instance of the Schedule class. The schedule class holds the functions for File IO as well as a hashtable (with linked lists as the values) to allow for a dynamically sized storage space. The quick accessibility of the hashtable is further enhanced by the flexibility of the linked lists.
